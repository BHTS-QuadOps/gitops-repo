# Kubernetes Clusters

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests for dev, staging, and prod environments.

Each environment defines:
- Application deployment
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment-specific replicas

**Note:** Local deployment requires a Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, EKS, etc.).  
These manifests are ready for deployment in any Kubernetes environment.
